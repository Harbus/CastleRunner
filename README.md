# Castle Runner

Traversing through castle floors, running from room to room, Castle Runner is an attempt to escape a castle. With the ability to speed run or fully explore the castle, rooms of enemies will attempt to slow you down from reaching your goal. With a variety of weapon upgrades to find, weapons will have a unique feel to them.

## Development
This was a group project for a game development class at Concordia University, and was created by a team of 6, including me. It was developed using C# on Unity.
